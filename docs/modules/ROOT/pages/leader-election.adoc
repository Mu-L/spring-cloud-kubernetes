= Leader Election

The Spring Cloud Kubernetes leader election mechanism implements the leader election API of Spring Integration using a Kubernetes ConfigMap.

Multiple application instances compete for leadership, but leadership will only be granted to one.
When granted leadership, a leader application receives an `OnGrantedEvent` application event with leadership `Context`.
Applications periodically attempt to gain leadership, with leadership granted to the first caller.
A leader will remain a leader until either it is removed from the cluster, or it yields its leadership.
When leadership removal occurs, the previous leader receives `OnRevokedEvent` application event.
After removal, any instances in the cluster may become the new leader, including the old leader.

To include it in your project, add the following dependency.
Fabric8 Leader Implementation
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-kubernetes-fabric8-leader</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

To specify the name of the configmap used for leader election use the following property.
[source,properties]
----
spring.cloud.kubernetes.leader.config-map-name=leader
----

== Leader Election Info Contributor

Spring Cloud Kubernetes Leader includes an `InfoContributor` which adds leader election information to
Spring Boot's `/actuator/info` endpoint. This contributor provides information about the current leader,
including the leader ID, role, and whether the current application instance is the leader.

Example output:
[source,json]
----
{
  "leaderElection": {
    "leaderId": "my-app-pod-1",
    "role": "my-role",
    "isLeader": true
  }
}
----

You can disable this `InfoContributor` by setting `management.info.leade.enabled`
to `false` in `application.[properties | yaml]`:

[source,properties]
----
management.info.leader.enabled=false
----
